# ENUT Analysis: Time Use in Care Economy in Colombia (2012-2013)

This repository contains the R code and data for analyzing the time use data from the National Time Use Survey (ENUT) in Colombia for the period 2012-2013. The project was developed as part of a joint undergraduate thesis in economics at the University of Pamplona.

## Data

The data required for running the code is included in the `data` directory of this repository. The data is organized as follows:

- `capítulos (chapters) 2012-2013`: ZIP file containing Chapter B, D, E and I data of the ENUT survey.
- ...

To use the data, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP files in the `data` directory.
3. The extracted data files will be available for analysis.

Alternatively, you can download the original data files from the official website of the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and replace the corresponding files in the `data` directory.

## Code

The R code for analyzing the ENUT data is provided in the `code.txt` file. The code performs various tasks, such as loading libraries, reading and processing the data, creating variables, and calculating the average time dedicated to different care-related activities in Colombia.

To run the code and perform the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have R and the required packages installed (tidyverse, haven).
2. Open the R script `code.txt` in your preferred R development environment.
3. Set the working directory to the location where you have saved the repository files.
4. Review and modify the code as needed to adapt it to your specific analysis requirements.
5. Run the script to perform the analysis.

The code will utilize the data files in the `data` directory to generate output files and/or visualizations that provide insights into the average time allocation for different care-related activities in Colombia during the period 2012-2013.
